# Sr. Cookie

This is a Python project used for point of sale and materials management for the company Sr. Cookie.

## Instructions to Set Up the Project

Follow these steps to configure the development environment and run the project on your local environment.

### Step 1: Create and Activate the Virtual Environment

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Execute the following command to create a virtual environment named "env":

    ```
    py -m venv env
    ```

4. Once the virtual environment has been created, access the scripts directory within the virtual environment:

    ```
    cd env\Scripts
    ```

5. Execute the `activate` command to activate the virtual environment:

    ```
    activate
    ```

6. This will activate the virtual environment and you should see `(env)` in the terminal prompt.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. After activating the virtual environment, return to the project's root directory:

    ```
    cd ../..
    ```

2. Once in the root directory, install the necessary dependencies using pip and the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 3: Run the Project

Now you're ready to run the project! You can do this by executing `py main.py`.

### Step 4: Remember to Comment the Code

Always remember to comment your code to make it more understandable for other developers and for yourself in the future. In Python, you can use triple quotes (`"""`) to comment code blocks, starting with `"""Start function """` and ending with `""" End function """`. In HTML and JavaScript, you can use `<!-- -->` to comment out code.
